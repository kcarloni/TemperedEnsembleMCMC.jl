An implementation of parallel-tempered, ensemble MCMC.

At the moment, the following are implemented:

    Proposal Moves:
        - Ensemble "Stretch" Move (GW10)

    Parallel Tempering Schemes:
        - Ladder of exponentially scaling temps, T = [1, dT^1, dT^2, ...]
            for user-input ladder size (ntemps) and dT (dtemps).
        - Control the overall likelihood of proposing temperature swaps at any step
            via "prob_propose_swap"; default = 0.1.

# to add:
# - read last SamplerState from saved .hdf5 file
# - parallelization options! 

# maybe:
# - calculate integrated_autocorrelation_time
